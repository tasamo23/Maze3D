# Maze3D

![A screenshot of the game](Screenshot.png)

A maze app, which was my first real 3D project I coded when I was 12 and features random progressive maze generation and pseudo-3D-rendering. You can double-click on the screen to go into fullscreen mode, and press M to open the map. You start from the green wall and have to get to the yellow wall by navigating with WASD or arrow keys.

Enjoy!
